## 📘 Python OOP – Complete Guide
- This repository provides a complete introduction to Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in Python, covering all core concepts with examples, exercises, and mini–projects.  
- Perfect for beginners, students, and interview preparation.

### What is OOP?

- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm where code is organized around objects — data + behavior.
- Why use OOP? 
- Increases reusability 
- Keeps code clean and organized 
- Easier to maintain large  
- Makes code modular and scalable 

### 🧱 Core Concepts of OOP

#### 1️⃣ Class
A class is a blueprint for creating objects.

```python
class Person:
    pass

```

#### 2️⃣ Object (Instance)
An object is created from a class.

```python
class Person:
    pass

p = Person()

```

#### 3️⃣ Attributes & Methods

```python
class Person:
    def __init__(self, name, age):   # constructor
        self.name = name             # attribute
        self.age = age

    def speak(self):                 # method
        return f"My name is {self.name}"
